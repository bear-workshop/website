In particular, I will discuss some of my team’s many robots including Brian, Casper, Tangy, Blueberry, Salt, Pepper, Chili, Hans Solo, and Luke and Leia that have been deployed in human-centred environments from long-term care homes and hospitals to grocery stores to autonomously provide cognitive and social interventions, help with activities of daily living, and lead individual-based and group-based recreational activities, games and therapies. Our novel multimodal interactive robots are serving as assistants to individuals as well as groups of users, while learning to personalize these interactions to the needs and wants of these users by using perceptual, behavioural and persuasive intelligence. Numerous user studies conducted in care settings will also be discussed to highlight how these socially assistive robots can effectively be integrated into people’s everyday lives to support person-centred care and overall wellbeing.',

        abstract: 'As socially assistive robots become increasingly integrated into healthcare and caregiving environments, the promise of personalization has never been more compelling, or more complex. In this keynote, I will explore how adaptive robotic systems can be designed to deliver meaningful, long-term support tailored to individual users’ needs, goals, preferences, and identities. Drawing on real-world deployments of socially intelligent robots in neurodiverse populations, including college students with ADHD, I will highlight how personalization through adaptive prompting, context modeling, and behavioral tailoring can enhance engagement, autonomy, and therapeutic alliance. However, with great personalization comes great responsibility. I will unpack the ethical dilemmas that emerge when robots learn to adapt: What boundaries should govern adaptive behavior? How can we ensure inclusivity and guard against algorithmic biases, overdependence, or surveillance creep? Can a robot’s empathy be both believable and bounded? Integrating perspectives from AI, human-robot interaction, and healthcare, this talk advocates for a value-centered design framework for personalization, one that balances behavioral adaptation with user agency, respects diversity, and embeds fairness and transparency by design. Ultimately, I argue that the next generation of personalized social robots must be not only intelligent and adaptive, but also accountable and inclusive.',

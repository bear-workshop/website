Socially assistive robots are a unique disruptive innovation that are becoming a crucial part of everyday society, especially in a post-pandemic world, aiding people in everyday life to meet urgent and immediate assistive needs. This talk will present some of my group’s recent research efforts (asblab.mie.utoronto.ca) in developing intelligent and persuasive socially assistive robots to improve quality of life and promote independence (aging-in-place) of older adults, including those living with dementia and their care providers. In particular, I will discuss some of my team’s many robots including Brian, Casper, Tangy, Blueberry, Salt, Pepper, Chili, Hans Solo, and Luke and Leia that have been deployed in human-centred environments from long-term care homes and hospitals to grocery stores to autonomously provide cognitive and social interventions, help with activities of daily living, and lead individual-based and group-based recreational activities, games and therapies. Our novel multimodal interactive robots are serving as assistants to individuals as well as groups of users, while learning to personalize these interactions to the needs and wants of these users by using perceptual, behavioural and persuasive intelligence. Numerous user studies conducted in care settings will also be discussed to highlight how these socially assistive robots can effectively be integrated into people’s everyday lives to support person-centred care and overall wellbeing.',

        abstract: 'As social robots will become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, ensuring their accessibility is essential. This presentation examines the vital role that accessibility plays in the design and implementation of social robots. Considering accessibility the design of social robots empowers everyone, including diverse user groups and individuals with disabilities, to engage fully with these innovative technologies. Throughout the presentation, we will explore the current state of the art in the field of  human-robot interaction, spotlighting both the promising developments and the challenges that remain in making social robots truly accessible for all. By tackling these challenges, we can pave the way for creating inclusive social robots.',
        bio: 'Friederike Eyssel is Professor of Psychology and head of the research group “Applied Social Psychology and Gender Research” at the Center for Cognitive Interaction Technology (CITEC), Bielefeld University, Germany. She has held visiting professorships in social psychology at the University of Münster, the Technical University of Dortmund, the University of Cologne, and the New York University Abu Dhabi. Friederike is passionate about basic and applied social psychological research and she is interested in various research topics ranging from social robotics, trust, and acceptance of novel techlologies to attitudes and attitude change. She is co-author of various textbooks on social robots, among them “HRI: An introduction (2020, 2024 Cambridge University Press, Hanser, 2020, 2022), “Robots in Education” (2021, Routledge), and “Theory and practice of sociosensitive and socioactive systems” (2022, Springer).

        secondaryAffiliation: '',
        abstract: 'As socially assistive robots become increasingly integrated into healthcare and caregiving environments, the promise of personalization has never been more compelling, or more complex. In this keynote, I will explore how adaptive robotic systems can be designed to deliver meaningful, long-term support tailored to individual users’ needs, goals, preferences, and identities. Drawing on real-world deployments of socially intelligent robots in neurodiverse populations, including college students with ADHD, I will highlight how personalization through adaptive prompting, context modeling, and behavioral tailoring can enhance engagement, autonomy, and therapeutic alliance. However, with great personalization comes great responsibility. I will unpack the ethical dilemmas that emerge when robots learn to adapt: What boundaries should govern adaptive behavior? How can we ensure inclusivity and guard against algorithmic biases, overdependence, or surveillance creep? Can a robot’s empathy be both believable and bounded? Integrating perspectives from AI, human-robot interaction, and healthcare, this talk advocates for a value-centered design framework for personalization, one that balances behavioral adaptation with user agency, respects diversity, and embeds fairness and transparency by design. Ultimately, I argue that the next generation of personalized social robots must be not only intelligent and adaptive, but also accountable and inclusive.',
